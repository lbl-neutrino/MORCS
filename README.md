Initial code for 2x2 / Mx2 central run control. Currently just a set of Python classes that can remotely start/stop runs in the LArPix, ADC64, and MINERvA DAQs.

This code depends on `mnvruncontrol` from [mx2-online](https://github.com/DUNE/mx2-online/), either copied/symlinked into this folder or found via `PYTHONPATH`.
